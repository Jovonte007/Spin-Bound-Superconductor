Marcellino Spin-Bound Superconductive Field Theory

By Jovonte Marcellino

Abstract:

This theory proposes that the superconducting state can be interpreted as a fused field behavior resulting from the interaction of diamagnetic and paramagnetic components, where induced spin coherence creates a magnetic shielding effect. It introduces a new interpretation of the Meissner effect, suggesting that superconductors act as stationary spinning magnets which actively reject external magnetic fields through a stabilized dual-field mechanism.

Core Principle:

When a diamagnetic material (which repels external magnetic fields) is brought into close proximity or fused structurally or dynamically with a paramagnetic material (which is attracted to magnetic fields), the opposing behaviors create a field bond. If this bond is subjected to or inherently supports coherent spin alignment (as occurs in superconductors), the result is a stabilized ferromagnetic domain — yet one that is locked in such a way that it expels new external fields.

This expulsion is not simply passive rejection; it is theorized to be a spin-induced field shield — a "bubble" created by internal coherent motion.

Theoretical Outline:

Diamagnetic Behavior = Repels field lines

Paramagnetic Behavior = Attracts field lines

Ferromagnetism = A stabilized alignment of dipoles; a composite of attraction and repulsion

Superconductors = A frozen spin system of electron pairs (Cooper pairs) that act as a frictionless medium


The fusion of diamagnetic and paramagnetic tendencies, when locked into a coherent phase (via temperature, pressure, or material structure), forms a spin-bound state that achieves:

1. Zero electrical resistance


2. Perfect magnetic expulsion (Meissner effect)


3. Flux pinning and levitation
