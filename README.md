ðŸ“˜ Overview

This repository presents a groundbreaking theory proposing that superconductivity arises from the stabilized fusion of diamagnetic and paramagnetic fields. The result is a spin-locked state that actively repels external magnetic interference â€” not due to the absence of magnetic behavior, but due to perfect field symmetry.

Jovonte Marcellino frames superconductors as stationary spinning magnets that create a dynamic field bubble. This bubble behaves like a magnetic shield, representing a deeper explanation for the Meissner effect and revealing new possibilities for engineered superconductive behavior.

ðŸ§ª Core Concepts

Diamagnetic + Paramagnetic = Ferromagnetic Domain

Static field + spin coherence = Flux expulsion

Superconductors = Quantum engines of spin symmetry

Magnetism = Field symmetry, not absence

ðŸ”¬ Suggested Experiments

Use paramagnetic and diamagnetic coils in hybrid setups.

Apply a high-frequency PWM signal to induce spin resonance.

Embed a superconductor or coated metal within the flux zone.

Observe for levitation, flux pinning, or resistance drop.
